can you explain about connection pooling in springboot
Advantage:
Reducing connection overhead: Establishing a connection to a database can be expensive. Reusing existing connections from the pool avoids this overhead.
Limiting the number of concurrent connections: Databases usually have limits on the number of simultaneous connections. Pooling prevents exceeding these limits.
Improving overall application responsiveness: Faster database interactions translate to faster overall application performance.

Spring Boot supports connection pooling automatically, making it easy to configure and use. Here's a breakdown:

Spring Boot defaults to HikariCP, a high-performance and robust connection pool implementation, unless other options are explicitly chosen.
Other cp services:
Tomcat JDBC Connection Pool
Apache Commons DBCP2:
C3P0

Configuration:
Spring Boot auto-configures the chosen connection pool based on available dependencies.
You can further customize pool settings through application properties (e.g., spring.datasource.hikari.maximumPoolSize) or annotations like @ConfigurationProperties.

Some of the springboot annotation which we don't really use in day to day.

Explain @Scope annotation.
Example of @Scope Annotation in Spring Boot:
The @Scope annotation in Spring Boot controls the lifespan of beans managed by Spring. Here's an example using different scopes:
1. Scopes Available:
@Scope("singleton"): The bean has a single instance throughout the application lifetime. (Default for Spring Boot beans)
@Scope("prototype"): A new instance of the bean is created for each injection point.
@Scope("session"): The bean instance is bound to the user's HTTP session (requires web environment).
@Scope("request"): The bean instance is bound to the current HTTP request (requires web environment).

2. Example Scenario:
Imagine you have a shopping cart service:
ShoppingCart could be @Scope("session") to maintain items across user sessions.
CartItem could be @Scope("prototype") to create separate instances for each item in the cart.
A service like CheckoutService would likely remain @Scope("singleton") for efficient management.

3. Code Example:
@Component
public class ShoppingCart {

    // List of cart items

    @Scope("prototype")
    public void addItem(Item item) {
        // Add item to cart
    }
}

@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class Item {

    // Item details

}

@Service
public class CheckoutService {

    @Autowired
    private ShoppingCart cart;

    public void checkout() {
        // Process checkout using shopping cart
    }
}

Explanation:
ShoppingCart maintains user's cart items across sessions, hence @Scope("session").
Each Item in the cart gets its own instance due to @Scope("prototype").
CheckoutService remains a singleton for efficient resource management.

Benefits:
Memory optimization: Scopes like prototype prevent unnecessary object creation.
Session management: Maintain user-specific state with @Scope("session").
Flexibility: Tailor bean lifecycles to your application's needs.

Remember:
Choose the appropriate scope based on your bean's usage and resource requirements.
Overusing @Scope("prototype") can increase memory usage.
Combine scopes effectively for optimal performance and maintainability.

what is the default scope of @Componenet, @Service, @Controller and @Repository?
All annotations you mentioned (@Component, @Service, @Controller, and @Repository) by default have the same scope, which is singleton. 

How can we modify the default scope of @Componenet, @Service, @Controller and @Repository annotations?
We can override the defatult singleton of these annotations by using @scope annotation.
For example @Scope("prototype"), put it on top of the class besides these annotations.

What is the use of @Lazy, @Value, @PropertySource, @ConfigurationProperties annotations?
@Lazy: 
Purpose: Delays the initialization of a Spring bean until it's first accessed.

@Value:
Purpose: Injects property values directly into fields or setter methods of a Spring

@PropertySource:
Purpose: Specifies the location of properties files used for injection with annotations like @Value, @ConfigurationProperties, or environment variables.

@ConfigurationProperties:
Purpose: Enables binding externalized properties (from files or environment variables) to a bean with nested structures.
Use cases:
Configuring complex beans with hierarchical property structures.
Simplifying complex configuration management with type safety and validation.
Features:
Supports nesting, collections, and custom conversion expressions.
Provides validation annotations for data integrity.

what is the difference between @PropertySource vs @ConfigurationProperties?
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "my.app")
class MyConfig {

    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getters and setters with validation annotations
}
Key Differences:
Functionality: @PropertySource simply loads properties, while @ConfigurationProperties binds them to bean structures.
Target: @PropertySource applies to files/directories, while @ConfigurationProperties affects the annotated bean.
Complexity: @PropertySource is simpler, while @ConfigurationProperties offers advanced features like nesting and validation.

When to use which:
Use @PropertySource for:
loading simple properties used with @Value or environment variables.
Specifying multiple configuration files.

Use @ConfigurationProperties for:
Binding complex configuration to "beans with nested structures."
Enforcing data types and validation on configuration values.

what is meant by beans with nested structures?
beans with nested structures refer to objects that have properties which are also objects themselves.
Here are some examples of beans with nested structures in Spring Boot:
Order bean: Containing nested objects for Customer, ShippingAddress, and OrderItems (list of products).
Employee bean: With nested objects for Department, Manager, and Skills (set of skill objects).
Product bean: Having nested objects for Category, Specifications, and Reviews (list of review objects).
